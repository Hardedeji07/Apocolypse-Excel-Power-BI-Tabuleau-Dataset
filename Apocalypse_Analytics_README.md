## üìä Recommended Visualizations

### **In Power BI / Tableau:**
- üìà *Survival Rate Dashboard*: Alive vs. Deceased by Region  
- üåç *Geographic Map*: Settlements with safety scores and resource levels  
- ‚öîÔ∏è *Faction Influence Chart*: Territory control and alliances  
- üíß *Resource Depletion Trends*: Over time by resource type  
- ‚ò†Ô∏è *Incident Heatmap*: Most affected regions and their impact  

### **In Excel:**
- Pivot tables for survival analysis  
- Conditional formatting for resource shortages  
- Dynamic charts for faction performance

## üßÆ KPIs You Can Derive

| KPI | Formula / Idea |
|------|----------------|
| **Survival Rate** | Alive √∑ Total Survivors |
| **Resource-to-Population Ratio** | Total Resources √∑ Population per Region |
| **Incident Frequency** | Incidents per Month per Region |
| **Faction Stability Index** | (Avg. Safety_Score √ó Alliance Factor) √∑ Incidents |
| **Population Growth / Decline** | (Current Population - Previous) √∑ Previous √ó 100 |

---

## üîç Analysis Ideas

- Which regions have the highest survival rates?  
- How does faction alliance affect safety scores?  
- What‚Äôs the correlation between incidents and resource scarcity?  
- Are certain resources consistently low across all safe zones?  
- Can we predict the next ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù area based on data trends?
